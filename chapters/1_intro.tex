DESCRIBE HOW IS THIS THESIS ORGANIZED

\section{Project objectives}
The aim of this Thesis, partially funded by the Allianz Insurance Company, is to produce flood risk maps over the complete Italian domain for both the present day climate and for future projections. Due to the requirements of a strictly physically-based reproducible scientific approach, a framework consisting in a model chain of three tried-and-tested models, spanning climate, hydrology, and hydraulics, was developed. This thesis thus describes a truly inter-disciplinary approach to flood risk modeling.
