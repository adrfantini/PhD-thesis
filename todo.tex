\chapter{Things to do, to think about, or which are missing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thesis or thesis, without capital letter
\item I, we, or passive form?
\item will be presented OPPURE was developed? In generale: futuro, o passato?
\item format all years with \\num? It does not appear to make any difference
\item use another style? I thik this one looks a bit too basic... the one from my previous thesis was nicer to look at
\item I used normal quotes, not latex quotes, all around, like "this"... could change them
\item I set Return Period (capital) everywhere. Is it ok?
\end{enumerate}
